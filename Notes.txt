Outputting attributes
* you can output some of attributes, like after ec2 instance is provisioned get public ip of instance

Remote state
terraform keeps remote state of infrastructure, file called terraform.tfstate
backup state in terraform.tfstate.backup
when you run terrafrom apply, a new terraform.tfstate and backup is written
eg, you terminate an instance managed by terraform, after terraform apply it will be started again.
